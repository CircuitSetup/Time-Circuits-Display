# Printing Notes

- The enclosure can be brinted in 2 pieces or 1 piece if you have a large enough bed. The 2 peices can be printed at the same time if you arrage them with the top down and the 'fins'perpendicular to eachother.
- keypad_body should be printed with the key side up, with supports, and perpendicular to the bed. Ironing in Cura is very helpful here so you do not have to sand forever. The example in pictures is not sanded at all and was printed with Spider Maker Matte Army Green.
- keypad_bezel should also be printed with the key side up, and supports. Ironing in Cura is very helpful here. The example in pictures is not painted at all.
- enter_button_spacer should be printed in white or clear since it can be seen under the enter button.
