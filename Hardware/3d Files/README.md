# 3d Printing Notes

- The outer enclosure can be printed in 2 pieces (_enclosure_left.stl, enclosure_right.stl_) or 1 piece (_enclosure_one_piece.stl_) if you have a large enough bed. The 2 pieces can be printed at the same time if you arrage them with the top down and the 'fins' perpendicular to eachother.
- _keypad_body.stl_ should be printed with the key side up, with supports, with the top perpendicular to the bed. Ironing in Cura can be used to smooth out the top surface. The example in pictures is not sanded/painted at all. [eSUN PLA PRO in Olive Green](https://amzn.to/3BTbkVD) is very very close to the color of the actual TRW keypad housing.
- _keypad_bezel.stl_ should also be printed with the key side up, and supports. Ironing in Cura can be used to smooth out the top surface. The example in pictures is not sanded/painted at all.
- _enter_button_spacer.stl_ should be printed in white or clear since it can be seen under the enter button.
- _last_time_bottom.stl_ and _present_dest_enclosure.stl_ should be printed face down. You will need 2 of present_dest_enclosure.stl since Destination Time and Present Time are the same. Neither should need supports.
- _display_faceplate.stl_ should be printed face down so the face is as smooth as possible. You will need 3 of these.
- 3mf files are the same as the stl files, but contain more detailed data
