# 3d Printing Notes

- The outer enclosure can be brinted in 2 pieces (enclosure_left.stl, enclosure_right.stl) or 1 piece (enclosure_one_piece.stl) if you have a large enough bed. The 2 pieces can be printed at the same time if you arrage them with the top down and the 'fins' perpendicular to eachother.
- keypad_body should be printed with the key side up, with supports, and perpendicular to the bed. Ironing in Cura is very helpful here so you do not have to sand the top of the keypad forever. The example in pictures is not sanded at all and was printed with Spider Maker Matte Army Green.
- keypad_bezel should also be printed with the key side up, and supports. Ironing in Cura is very helpful here. The example in pictures is not painted at all.
- enter_button_spacer should be printed in white or clear since it can be seen under the enter button.
- last_time_bottom.stl and present_dest_enclosure.stl should be printed face down. You will need 2 of present_dest_enclosure.stl since Destination Time and Present Time are the same. Neither should need supports
- Any 3mf files are the same as the stl files but contail Cura slicing information.
