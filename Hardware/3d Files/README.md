# 3d Printing
### What to print for the most recent version of the TCD:
#### Keypad:
- _keypad_body_v3-3_hole_mount_ - print with the face down. [eSUN PLA PRO in Olive Green](https://amzn.to/3BTbkVD) is very very close to the color of the actual TRW keypad housing.
- _keypad_body_v3_surround_ - later glued on to the face of _keypad_body_v3_
- _keypad_body_v3_clear_ - later glued on to the face of _keypad_body_v3_. Use a 0.2 nozzle if available.
- _keypad_bezel-v3_ - print in white with the key side up, and supports. Ironing in your slicer can be used to smooth out the top surface. The example in pictures is not sanded/painted at all.

#### Enclosures:
Print all in a silver or grey color
- _enclosure_one_piece-v4_
- _dest_time_enclosure-v2.5_
- _pres_time_enclosure-v2.5_
- _last_time_enclosure-v2.5_ - print face down with supports (for the speaker mounting tabs)
- _display_faceplate_ (x3) - print face down so the face is as smooth as possible. You will need 3 of these.
