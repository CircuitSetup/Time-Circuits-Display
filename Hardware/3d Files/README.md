# 3d Printing Notes

- The outer enclosure can be printed in 2 pieces (_enclosure_left.stl, enclosure_right.stl_) or 1 piece (_enclosure_one_piece.stl_) if you have a large enough bed. The 2 pieces can be printed at the same time if you arrage them with the top down and the 'fins' perpendicular to eachother.
- _keypad_body.stl_ should be printed with the key side up, with supports, and perpendicular to the bed. Ironing in Cura is very helpful here so you do not have to sand the top of the keypad forever. The example in pictures is not sanded at all and was printed with Spider Maker Matte Army Green.
- _keypad_bezel.stl_ should also be printed with the key side up, and supports. Ironing in Cura is very helpful here. The example in pictures is not painted at all.
- _enter_button_spacer.stl_ should be printed in white or clear since it can be seen under the enter button.
- _last_time_bottom.stl_ and _present_dest_enclosure.stl_ should be printed face down. You will need 2 of present_dest_enclosure.stl since Destination Time and Present Time are the same. Neither should need supports.
- _display_faceplate.stl_ should be printed face down so the face is as smooth as possible. You will need 3 of these.
- Any 3mf files are the same as the stl files but contain Cura slicing information.
