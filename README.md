# Time Circuits Display

This Time Circuits Display has been meticulously reproducted to be as accurate as possible from the movie. The LED displays are custom made to the correct size for CircuitSetup.

The current code is not complete, but the Destination Time can be entered via keypad, and the Present Time can keep time with NTP via ESP32. There is also a time travel mode, which moves the Destination Time to Present Time, and Present Time to Last Time Departed.
