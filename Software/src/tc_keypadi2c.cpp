|| @description
|| | Keypad_I2C provides an interface for using matrix keypads that
|| | are attached with I2C port expanders. It supports multiple keypads,
|| | user selectable pins, and user defined keymaps.
|| #
||
|| @version 2.0 - April 5, 2020
|| | MKRZERO, ESP32 compile error from inheriting TwoWire that was OK with
|| | original ATMEGA boards; possibly because newer processors can have
|| | multiple I2C WireX ports. Consequently, added the ability to specify
|| | an alternate Wire as optional parameter in constructor.
