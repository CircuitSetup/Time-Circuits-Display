/* Changelog 
 *  
 *  2022/08/15 (A10001986)
 *    - Time logic re-written. RTC now always keeps real actual present
 *      time, all fake times are calculated off the RTC time. 
 *      This makes the device independent of NTP; the RTC can be manually 
 *      set through the keypad menu ("RTC" is now displayed to remind the 
 *      user that he is actually setting the *real* time clock).
 *    - Alarm base can now be selected between RTC (ie actual present
 *      time, what is stored in the RTC), or "present time" (ie fake
 *      present time).
 *  2022/08/13 (A10001986)
 *    - Changed "fake power" logic : This is no longer a "button" to  
 *      only power on, but a switch. The unit can now be "fake" powered 
 *      and "fake" powered off. 
 *    - External time travel trigger: Connect active-low button to
 *      io14 (see tc_global.h). Upon activation (press for 200ms), a time
 *       travel is triggered. Note that the device only simulates the 
 *      re-entry part of a time travel so the trigger should be timed 
 *      accordingly.
 *    - Fix millis() roll-over errors
 *    - All new sounds. The volume of the various sound effects has been
 *      normalized, and the sound quality has been digitally enhanced.
 *    - Make keypad more responsive
 *    - Fix garbled keypad sounds in menu
 *    - Fix timeout logic errors in menu
 *    - Make RTC usable for eternity (by means of yearOffs)
 *  2022/08/12 (A10001986)
 *    - A-Car display support enhanced (untested)
 *    - Added SD support. Audio files will be played from SD, if
 *      an SD is found. Files need to reside in the root folder of
 *      a FAT-formatted SD and be named 
 *      - "startup.mp3": The startup sound
 *      - "enter.mp3": The sound played when a date was entered
 *      - "baddate.mp3": If a bad date was entered
 *      - "timetravel.mp3": A time travel was triggered
 *      - "alarm.mp3": The alarm sound
 *      - "nmon.mp3": Night mode is enabled
 *      - "nmoff.mp3": Night mode is disabled*      
 *      - "alarmon.mp3": The alarm was enabled
 *      - "alarmoff.mp3": The alarm was disabled      
 *      Mp3 files with 128kpbs or below recommended. 
 *  2022/08/11 (A10001986)
 *    - Integrate a modified Keypad_I2C into the project in order 
 *      to fix the "ghost" key presses issue by reducing i2c traffic 
 *      and validating the port status data by reading the value
 *      twice.
 *  2022/08/10 (A10001986)
 *    - Added "fake power on" facility. Device will boot, setup 
 *      WiFi, sync time with NTP, but not start displays until
 *      an active-low button is pressed (connected to io13, see 
 *      tc_global.h)
 *  2022/08/10 (A10001986)
 *    - Nightmode now also reduced volume of sound (except alarm)
 *    - Fix autoInterval array size
 *    - Minor cleanups
 *  2022/08/09 (A10001986)
 *    - Fix "animation" (ie. month displayed a tad delayed)
 *    - Added night mode; enabled by holding "4", disabled by holding "5"
 *    - Fix for flakey i2c connection to RTC (check data and retry)
 *      Sometimes the RTC chip loses sync and no longer responds, this
 *      happens rarely and is still under investigation.
 *    - Quick alarm enable/disable: Hold "1" to enable, "2" to disable
 *    - If alarm is enabled, the dot in present time's minute field is lit
 *    - Selectable "persistent" time travel mode (WiFi Setup page):
 *        If enabled, time travel is persistent, which means all times
 *        changed during a time travel are saved to EEPROM, overwriting 
 *        user programmed times. In persistent mode, the fake present time  
 *        also continues to run during power loss, and is NOT reset to 
 *        actual present time upon restart.
 *        If disabled, user programmed times are never overwritten, and
 *        time travels are not persistent. Present time will be reset
 *        to actual present time after power loss.
 *    - Alarm data is now saved to file system, no longer to EEPROM
 *      (reduces wear on flash memory)
 *  2022/08/03-06 (A10001986)
 *    - Alarm function added
 *    - 24-hour mode added for non-Americans (though not authentic at all)
 *    - Keypad menu item to show IP address added
 *    - Configurable WiFi connection timeouts and retries
 *    - Keypad menu re-done
 *    - "Present time" is a clock (not stale) after time travel
 *    - Return from Time Travel (hold "9" for 2 seconds)
 *    - Support for time zones and automatic DST
 *    - More stable sound playback
 *    - various bug fixes
